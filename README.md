<h1>Guide to selfhost nyxus</h1>
<h2>Part 1 | Creating a discord bot</h2>
<p>Id suggest just watching a youtube tutorial on how to make a bot, make sure all the intents are selected and you have the token, once you have it, move on to Part 2</p>
<h2>Part 2 | Actually running it</h2>
<p>Install python, go to your terminal and use pip install colorama, pip install discord, and pip install all of these:
import discord
import os
import aiohttp
import requests
import random
import json
import io
import asyncio
These are all of the used imports, So id suggest installing them for best performance.</p>
<h2>Part 3 | Using the token</h2>
<p>Neat the top where it says token = 'MTI3 etc..' Replace the current token with your token, then simply run it from either terminal or vs code (assuming you are using it) and invite the bot, you do need to create your own
bot invite with oauth</p>
<h1>Extra</h1>
<h2>Part 3.5 | Launch nyxus ui</h2>
<p>Go to the folder that you have all the nyxus stuff in, the README.md file is not neccessary, but you can keep it if you want. At the top where the directory is, simply type python nyxus.py</p>
